In order to use the animals static library that you created, 
do the following, in the Eclipse IDE:

- Right click your Project under “Package Explorer” and select Properties.

- Select "C/C++ General > Paths and Symbols"

- In the "Library Paths" section, add the path were the library 
files (.a for MacOS) can be found: in this case it is the `libanimals.a` file
(this is the -L option)

- In the "Libraries" section, add the names of the libraries, not of the 
files: in this case the filename is `libanimals.a` but the actual name 
of the library is `animals` 
(this is the -l option)

- In the "Includes" section, add the path were (the library's) .h files to 
be included are: in this case the file `Cat.h`
(this is the -I option)
